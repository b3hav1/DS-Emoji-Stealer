## How to use
`/steal [emojis]` Allows you to copy a list of emojis from the servers available to you, separating them whitespace. The process may take some time.
> If you don't have **Nitro**, you can send the required emoji to the host server by prefixing each with a backslash `\`, and then copy the message text.

`/create <name> <url>` Allows you to create emoji directly from an image link. Does not support a list, but allows you to copy emoji from servers that are inavailable to you.
> You can copy a link to an emoji image via the context menu, just like any other image.
